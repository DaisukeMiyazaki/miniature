# What is Miniature

**Miniature is an ongoing art project. While looking just like a display mounted on a wall, it's intended to be a pretty cover for wifi routers and home server, and more.**

While every home has a Wi-Fi router, it's usually an eyesore tucked away in a corner. With more people spending time at home due to the pandemic, many are looking to refresh their living spaces and make them more aesthetically pleasing. The router is one item that could use a makeover and bring something new into the room.

Other people have found themselves working from home and losing track of time, or feeling like they're stuck in a rut and unable to think about anything other than work. Miniature art was born out of these struggles, as a way to create a space where people can pause and reflect on what's important. While Wi-Fi is an essential part of modern life, everyone has their own priorities and values. Creating a miniature that reflects your personal style is part of the fun. Here, I'll introduce some miniatures that I've created to suit my own tastes.
